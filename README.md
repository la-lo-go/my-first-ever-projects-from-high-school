> These were my first projects back in 2016-2017, so the code quality is VERY FAR from the best. Its purpose is to show how everyone starts somewhere and that it's okay to have bad code at the beginning.

> These couple of project helped me learn the basics of programming (in C++) and also study the physics of light and planets in a fun way.
> 
> I'm proud of my progress since then, and I hope this repository can inspire others to start coding and show that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.
